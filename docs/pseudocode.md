# AI-Powered Knowledge Graph to Manim Animation Automation

## Overview
This document explains the workflow and thought process for building a system that converts educational content from books into animated videos using AI and Manim. The system consists of three main parts:

1. Knowledge Graph ingestion
2. AI slide & script generation
3. Manim animation creation

## **Step 1: Knowledge Graph (Neo4j) Ingestion**

**Goal:** Store book content in a structured way so concepts can be retrieved easily.

**Pseudocode:**


**Explanation:**  
- We use Neo4j to store `Concept` and `Sentence` nodes.  
- Relationships allow quick retrieval of all sentences related to a concept.  
- NLP can be used to extract important concepts automatically.

---

## **Step 2: AI Slide & Script Generation**

**Goal:** Generate slides and explanatory script for a user-requested concept.

**Pseudocode:**


**Explanation:**  
- AI (like GPT or a fine-tuned model) converts raw sentences into readable explanations.  
- Slides are structured: title + bullet points.  
- Script is detailed text narration for the video.

---

## **Step 3: Manim Animation Generation**

**Goal:** Convert the AI-generated slides into animated educational videos.

**Explanation:**  
- Manim is used to visually render slides.  
- Animations can include simple text animations or transitions.  
- Output is a video file that students can watch.

## **Pipeline Diagram**


**Notes:**  
- Each block can be developed independently.  
- Manim scripts can be placeholders if full installation is not available.  
- This pipeline shows the flow from raw book content to educational video.

## **Thought Process & Trade-offs**

- Using Neo4j allows **easy retrieval of related concepts**.  
- AI slide generation is modular; can switch models or fine-tune for domain.  
- Manim visualization is optional; for submission, placeholder scripts demonstrate pipeline.  
- Focus on **demonstrable pipeline** rather than full production-ready system.
